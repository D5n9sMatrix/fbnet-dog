Applicant’s Representations
1. Each Series will be a series of a
Trust and each Trust will be a UIT
registered under the Act.2 The Depositor
is registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer
and is the depositor of each Series. Each
Series will be created by a trust
indenture between the Depositor and a
banking institution or trust company as
trustee (‘‘Trustee’’).
2. The Depositor acquires a portfolio
of securities, which it deposits with the
Trustee in exchange for certificates
representing units of fractional
undivided interest in the Series’
portfolio (‘‘Units’’). The Units are
offered to the public by the Depositor
and dealers at a price which, during the
initial offering period, is based upon the
aggregate market value of the underlying
securities plus a front-end sales charge.
The Depositor may reduce the sales
charge in compliance with rule 22d–1
under the Act in certain circumstances,
which are disclosed in the prospectus.
3. The Depositor will maintain a
secondary market for Units and
continually offer to purchase these
Units at prices based upon the market
value of the underlying securities.
Investors may purchase Units on the
secondary market at the current public
offering prices plus a front-end sales
charge. If the Depositor discontinues
maintaining such a market at any time
for any Series, holders of the Units
(‘‘Unitholders’’) of that Series may
redeem their Units through the Trustee.
A. Deferred Sales Charge and Waiver of
Deferred Sales Charge Under Certain
Circumstances
following is a summary of the
application. The complete application
may be obtained for a fee at the
Commission’s Public Reference Branch,1. Applicants request an order to the
extent necessary to permit one or more
Series to impose a sales charge on a
deferred basis (‘‘deferred sales charge’’
or ‘‘DSC’’). For each Series, the
Depositor would set a maximum sales
charge per Unit, a portion of which may
be collected ‘‘up front’’ (i.e., at the time
an investor purchases the Units). The
DSC would be collected subsequently in
installments (‘‘Installment Payments’’)
as described in the application. The
Depositor would not add any amount
for interest or any similar or related
charge to adjust for such deferral.
2. When a Unitholder redeems or sells
Units, the Depositor intends to deduct
any unpaid DSC from the redemption or
sale proceeds. When calculating the
1 Any future Series that relies on the requested
order will comply with the terms and conditions of
the application.2 All presently existing Trusts that currently
intend to rely on the requested order have been
name as applicants.

amount due, the Depositor will assume
that Units on which the DSC has been
paid in full are redeemed or sold first.
With respect to Units on which the DSC
has not been paid in full, the Depositor
will assume that the Units held for the
longest time are redeemed or sold first.
Applicants represent that the DSC
collected at the time of redemption or
sale, together with the Installment
Payments and any amount collected up
front, will not exceed the maximum
sales charge per Unit. Under certain
circumstances, the Depositor may waive
the collection of any unpaid DSC in
connection with redemptions or sales of
Units. These circumstances will be
disclosed in the prospectus for the
relevant Series and implemented in
accordance with rule 22d–1 under the
Act.
3. Each Series offering Units subject to
a DSC will state the maximum charge
per Unit in its prospectus. In addition,
the prospectus for such Series will
include the table required by Form N–
1A (modified as appropriate to reflect
the difference between UITs and open-
end management investment
companies) and a schedule setting forth
the number and date of each Installment
Payment, along with the duration of the
collection period. The prospectus also
will disclose that portfolio securities
may be sold to pay an Installment
Payment if distribution income is
insufficient, and that securities will be
sold pro rata or a specific security will
be designated for sale.
B. Exchange Option and Rollover
Option
1. Applicants request an order to the
extent necessary to permit Unitholders
of a Series to exchange their Units for
Units to another Series (‘‘Exchange
Option’’) and Unitholders of a Series
that is terminating to exchange their
Units for Units for a new Series of the
same type (‘‘Rollover Option’’). The
Exchange Option and Rollover Option
would apply to all exchanges of Units
sold with a front-end sales charge or
DSC.
2. A Unitholder who purchases Units
under the Exchange Option or Rollover
Option would pay a lower sales charge
than that which would be paid for the
Units by a new investor. The reduced
sales charge will be reasonably related
to the expenses incurred in connection
with the administration of the DSC
program, which may include an amount
that will fairly and adequately
compensate the Depositor and
participating underwriters and brokers
for their services in providing the DSC
program.

3. Pursuant to the Exchange Option,
an adjustment would be made if Units
of any Series are exchanged within five
months of their acquisition for Units of
a Series with a higher sales charge
(‘‘Five Months Adjustment’’). An
adjustment also would be made if Units
on which a DSC is collected are
exchanged for Units of a Series that
imposes a front-end sales charge and the
exchange occurs before the DSC
collected (plus any amount collected up
front on the exchanged Units) at least
equals the per Unit sales charge on the
acquired Units (‘‘DSC Front-End
Exchange Adjustment’’). If an exchange
involves either the Five Months
Adjustment or the DSC Front-End
Exchange Adjustment, the Unitholder
would pay the greater of the reduced
sales charge or an amount which,
together with the sales charge already
paid on the exchanged Units, equals the
normal sales charge on the acquired
Units on the date of the exchange. With
appropriate disclosures, the Depositor
may waive such payment. Further, the
Depositor would reserve the right to
vary the sales charge normally
applicable to a Series and the charge
applicable to exchanges, as well as to
modify, suspend, or terminate the
Exchange Option as set forth in the
conditions to the application.
Applicant’s Legal Analysis
A. DSC and Waiver of DSC
1. Section 4(2) of the Act defines a
‘‘unit investment trust’’ as an
investment company that issues only
redeemable securities. Section 2(a)(32)
of the Act defines a ‘‘redeemable
security’’ as a security that, upon its
presentation to the issuer, entitles the
holder to receive approximately his or
her proportionate share of the issuer’s
current net assets or the cash equivalent
of those assets. Rule 22c–1 under the
Act requires that the price of a
redeemable security issued by a
registered investment company for
purposes of sale, redemption or
repurchase be based on the security’s
current net asset value (‘‘NAV’’).
Because the collection of any unpaid
DSC may cause a redeeming Unitholder
to receive an amount less than the NAV
of the redeemed Units, applicants
request relief from section 2(a)(32) and
rule 22c–1.
2. Section 22(d) of the Act and rule
22d–1 under the Act require a registered
investment company and its principal
underwriter and dealers to sell
securities only at the current public
offering price described in the
investment company’s prosectus, with
the exception of sales of redeemable
PO 00000
Frm 00075
Fmt 4703
Sfmt 4703
securities at prices that reflect
scheduled variations in the sales loan.
Section 2(a)(35) of the Act defines the
term ‘‘sales load’’ as the difference
between the sales price and the portion
of the proceeds invested by the
depositor or trustee. Applicants request
relief from section 2(a)(35) and section
22(d) to permit waivers, deferrals or
other scheduled variations of the sales
load.
3. Under section 6(c) of the Act, the
Commission may exempt classes of
transactions, if and to the extent that
such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of
the Act. Applicants state that their
proposal meets the standards of section
6(c). Applicants state that the provisions
of section 22(d) are intended to prevent
(a) riskless trading in investment
company securities due to backward
pricing, (b) disruption of orderly
distribution by dealers selling shares at
a discount, and (c) discrimination
among investors resulting from different
prices charged to different investors.
Applicants assert that the proposed DSC
program will present none of these
abuses. Applicants further state that all
scheduled variations in the sales load
will be disclosed in the prospectus of
each Series and applied uniformly to all
investors, and that applicants will
comply with all the conditions set forth
in rule 22d–1.
4. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act, in
relevant part, prohibits a trustee or
custodian of a UIT from collecting from
the trust as an expense any payment to
the trust’s depositor or principal
underwriter. Because the Trustee’s
payment of the DSC to the Depositor
may be deemed to be an expense under
section 26(a)(2)(C), applicants request
relief under section 6(c) from section
26(a)(2)(C) to the extent necessary to
permit the Trustee to collect Installment
Payments and disburse them to the
Depositor. Applicants submit that the
relief is appropriate because the DSC is
more properly characterized as a sales
load.
B. Exchange Option and Rollover
Option
1. Sections 11(a) and (c) of the Act
prohibit any offer of exchange by a UIT
for the securities of another investment
company unless the terms of the offer
have been approved in advance by the
Commission. Applicants request an
order under sections 11(a) and 11(c) for
Commission approval of the Exchange
Option and the Rollover Option.
Applicants state that the Five Months
E:\FR\FM\25JYN1.SGM
pfrm13
PsN: 25JYN1Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 143 / Thursday, July 25, 2002 / Notices
Adjustment and the DSC Front-End
Exchange Adjustment in certain
circumstances are appropriate to
maintain the equitable treatment of
various investors in each Series.
C. Net Worth Requirement
1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires
that a registered investment company
have $100,000 of net worth prior to
making a public offering. Applicants
state that each Series will comply with
this requirement because the Depositor
will deposit substantially more than
$100,000 of debt and/or equity
securities, depending on the objective of
the particular Series. Applicants assert,
however, that the Commission has
interpreted section 14(a) as requiring
that the initial capital investment in an
investment company be made without
any intention to dispose of the
investment. Applicants state that, under
this interpretation, a Series would not
satisfy section 14(a) because of the
Depositor’s intention to sell of the Units
of the Series.
2. Rule 14a–3 under the Act exempts
UITs from section 14(a) if certain
conditions are met, one of which is that
the UIT invest only in ‘‘eligible trust
securities,’’ as defined in the rule.
Applicants state that they may not rely
on rule 14a–3 because certain future
Series (collectively, ‘‘Equity Series’’)
will invest all or a portion of their assets
in equity securities or registered
investment company securities pursuant
to an exemptive order, which do not
satisfy the definition of eligible trust
securities.
3. Applicants request an exemption
under section 6(c) of the Act to the
extent necessary to exempt the Equity
Series from the net worth requirement
in section 14(a). Applicants state that
the Series and the Depositor will
comply in all respects with the
requirement of rule 14a–3, except that
the Equity Series will not restrict their
portfolio investment to ‘‘eligible trust
securities.’’
D. Capital Gains Distribution
1. Section 19(b) of the Act and rule
19b–1 under the Act provide that,
except under limited circumstances, no
registered investment company may
distribute long-term gains more than
once every twelve months. Rule 19b–
1(c), under certain circumstances,
exempts a UIT investing in eligible trust
securities (as defined in rule 14a–3)
from the requirements of rule 19b–1.
Because the Equity Series do not limit
their investments to eligible trust
securities, however, the Equity Series
will not qualify for the exemption in
paragraph (c) of rule 19b–1. Applicants
VerDate Jul<19>2002
19:27 Jul 24, 2002
Jkt 197001
therefore request an exemption under
section 6(c) from section 19(b) and rule
19b–1 to the extent necessary to permit
capital gains earned in connection with
the sale of portfolio securities to be
distributed to Unitholders along with
the Equity Series’ regular distributions.
In all other respects, applicants will
comply with section 19(b) and rule 19b–
1.
2. Applicants state that their proposal
meets the standard of section 6(c).
Applicants assert that any sale of
portfolio securities would be triggered
by the need to meet Series’ expenses,
Installment Payments, or by redemption
requests, events over which the
Depositor and the Equity Series do not
have control. Applicants further state
that, because principal distributions
must be clearly indicated in
accompanying reports to Unitholders as
a return of principal and will be
relatively small in comparison to
normal dividend distributions, there is
little danger of confusion from failure to
differentiate among distributions.
Applicants’ Conditions
Applicants agree that the order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following conditions:
A. DSC and Exchange and Rollover
Options
1. Whenever the Exchange Option or
the Rollover Option is to be terminated
or its terms are to be amended
materially, any holder of a security
subject to that privilege will be given
prominent notice of the impending
termination or amendment at least 60
days prior to the date of termination or
the effective date of the amendment,
provided that: (a) No such notice need
be given if the only material effect of an
amendment is to reduce or eliminate the
sales charge payable at the time of an
exchange, to add one or more new
Series eligible for the Exchange Option
or the Rollover Option, or to delete a
Series which has terminated; and (b) no
notice need be given if, under
extraordinary circumstances, either (i)
there is a suspension of the redemption
of Units of the Series under section
22(e) of the Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated under that
section, or (ii) a Series temporarily
delays or ceases the sale of its Units
because it is unable to invest amounts
effectively in accordance with
applicable investment objectives,
policies and restrictions.
2. An investor who purchases Units
under the Exchange Option or the
Rollover Option will pay a lower sales
charge than that which would be paid
for the Units by a new investor.

3. The prospectus of each Series
offering exchanges or rollovers and any
sales literature or advertising that
mentions the existence of the Exchange
Option or Rollover Option will disclose
that the Exchange Option and the
Rollover Option are subject to
modification, termination or suspension
without notice, except in certain limited
cases.
4. Any DSC imposed on a Series’
Units will comply with the
requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2)
and (3) of rule 6c–10(a) under the Act.
5. Each Series offering Units subject to
a DSC will include in its prospectus the
disclosure required in Form N–1A
relating to deferred sales charges,
modified as appropriate to reflect the
differences between UITs and open-end
management investment companies,
and a schedule setting forth the number
and date of each Installment Payment.
B. Net Worth Requirement
Applicant will comply in all respects
with the requirements of rule 14a–3,
except that the Equity Series will not
restrict their portfolio investments to
‘‘eligible trust securities.’’

Investment Management, under delegated
